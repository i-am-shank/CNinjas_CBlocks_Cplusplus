1. The Basics (simultaneous move games) :-

--> Strict dominance
--> Iterated elimination (of strictly dominated strategies)
--> Pure strategy Nash equilibrium
--> Best responses
--> Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
--> Weak dominance

2. Extensive Form Games (games where players take turns moving)

--> Backward induction
--> Subgame perfect equilibrium
--> Credible threats
--> Tying hands
--> Commitment problems
--> Forward induction

3. Advanced Strategic Form Games (chapter1, biased cases)

--> Comparative statics
--> Knife-edge equilibria
--> Symmetric zero-sum games
